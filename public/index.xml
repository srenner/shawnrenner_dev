      <title>SVO Registry</title>

      <description>The SVO Registry was written in Python, using the Django framework, and using PostgreSQL as the data store. On the front end it has Bootstrap and a few jQuery plugins. It can be found at svoregistry.com.
I am currently re-writing the site as a .NET Blazor Wasm project, and I&amp;rsquo;m making it multi-tenant so that other types of vehicles or collector items can be hosted as their own registry. The GitHub repo is here.</description>

      <description>MegaSquirt is an aftermarket automotive ECU that controls a car&amp;rsquo;s fuel injection and ignition system. I got started with it in 2009, and it&amp;rsquo;s what initially got me interested in embedded programming and hobby electronics. Spiritually, MegaSquirt is to car ECUs what the Raspberry Pi is for computers. It&amp;rsquo;s affordable, educational, and DIY friendly.
I am currently using a self-built MegaSquirt II to power my 1986 Mustang SVO. MegaSquirt is ideal for early fuel injection cars of the 1980s and 1990s.</description>

      <description>I just finished uploading v1.0.0 of the site, which features a landing page with links, a simple &amp;ldquo;about&amp;rdquo; page, a long form résumé, and this blog.
Next on my list is to create a more traditional pdf résumé, and start a &amp;ldquo;projects&amp;rdquo; section to highlight some projects I have been working on.</description>

      <description>This is the newest version of my personal website, which will host my professional profile as well as some side projects and hobbies. I am building this with a static site generator named Hugo. I like Hugo because it performs well and allows me to write content in Markdown format.</description>
