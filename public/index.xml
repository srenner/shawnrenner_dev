      <title>CompostBuddy</title>

      <description>With home composting, you want your material to break down in a thermophilic temperature range between about 135°F and 160°F. This is warm enough to kill pathogenic organisms and weed seeds, and ensures an efficient breakdown of organic material. The compost must be occasionally &amp;ldquo;turned&amp;rdquo; or tumbled to properly aerate the pile and ensure all the material is subjected to the heat.
To help keep track of my compost temperature and aeration, I built this WiFi connected IoT project.</description>

      <title>SVO Registry</title>
      <link>https://shawnrenner.dev/projects/svo-registry/</link>

      <description>I created the original SVO Registry several years ago. I was new to ASP.NET MVC, but at the time, the server-side frameworks I was more curious about were Ruby on Rails and Django. I settled on using Django, because I had been looking for a good reason to take a deeper dive into Python programming. Other tools in use are PostgreSQL, Bootstrap, a few jQuery plugins, and the Whoosh search engine.</description>

      <title>MegaSquirt</title>

      <description>MegaSquirt is an aftermarket automotive ECU that controls a car&amp;rsquo;s fuel injection and ignition system. I got started with it in 2009, and it&amp;rsquo;s what initially got me interested in embedded programming and hobby electronics. Spiritually, MegaSquirt is to car ECUs what the Raspberry Pi is for computers. It&amp;rsquo;s affordable, educational, and DIY friendly.
I am currently using a self-built MegaSquirt II to power my 1986 Mustang SVO. MegaSquirt is ideal for early fuel injection cars of the 1980s and 1990s.</description>

      <description>I just finished uploading v1.0.0 of the site, which features a landing page with links, a simple &amp;ldquo;about&amp;rdquo; page, a long form résumé, and this blog.
Next on my list is to create a more traditional pdf résumé, and start a &amp;ldquo;projects&amp;rdquo; section to highlight some projects I have been working on.</description>

      <description>This is the newest version of my personal website, which will host my professional profile as well as some side projects and hobbies. I am building this with a static site generator named Hugo. I like Hugo because it performs well and allows me to write content in Markdown format.</description>

      <title>Home Assistant</title>

      <description>I use a self-hosted Home Assistant installation for my home automation setup. I primarily use Z-Wave devices at home because they are good quality, low power, and are not connected to the Internet. I am also curious about where Matter will go, because it seems to be getting attention from a lot of big tech companies.
I have placed backups of my Home Assistant configuration files in this GitHub repository.</description>
