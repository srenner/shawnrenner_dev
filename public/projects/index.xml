      <title>CompostBuddy</title>

      <description>With home composting, you want your material to break down in a thermophilic temperature range between about 135°F and 160°F. This is warm enough to kill pathogenic organisms and weed seeds, and ensures an efficient breakdown of organic material. The compost must be occasionally &amp;ldquo;turned&amp;rdquo; or tumbled to properly aerate the pile and ensure all the material is subjected to the heat.
To help keep track of my compost temperature and aeration, I built this WiFi connected IoT project.</description>

      <title>Home Assistant</title>

      <description>I use a self-hosted Home Assistant installation for my home automation setup. I primarily use Z-Wave devices at home because they are good quality, low power, and are not connected to the Internet. I am also curious about where Matter will go, because it seems to be getting attention from a lot of big tech companies.
I have placed backups of my Home Assistant configuration files in this GitHub repository.</description>

      <title>SVO Registry</title>

      <description>The SVO Registry was written in Python, using the Django framework, and using PostgreSQL as the data store. On the front end it has Bootstrap and a few jQuery plugins. It can be found at svoregistry.com.
I am currently re-writing the site as a .NET Blazor Wasm project called CollectorRegistry, and I&amp;rsquo;m making it multi-tenant so that other types of vehicles or collector items can be hosted as their own registry.</description>

      <title>MegaSquirt</title>

      <description>MegaSquirt is an aftermarket automotive ECU that controls a car&amp;rsquo;s fuel injection and ignition system. I got started with it in 2009, and it&amp;rsquo;s what initially got me interested in embedded programming and hobby electronics. Spiritually, MegaSquirt is to car ECUs what the Raspberry Pi is for computers. It&amp;rsquo;s affordable, educational, and DIY friendly.
I am currently using a self-built MegaSquirt II to power my 1986 Mustang SVO. MegaSquirt is ideal for early fuel injection cars of the 1980s and 1990s.</description>
