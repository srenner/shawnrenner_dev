      <title>SVO Registry</title>

      <description>The SVO Registry was written in Python, using the Django framework, and using PostgreSQL as the data store. On the front end it has Bootstrap and a few jQuery plugins. It can be found at svoregistry.com.
I am currently re-writing the site as a .NET Blazor Wasm project, and I&amp;rsquo;m making it multi-tenant so that other types of vehicles or collector items can be hosted as their own registry. The GitHub repo is here.</description>

      <description>MegaSquirt is an aftermarket automotive ECU that controls a car&amp;rsquo;s fuel injection and ignition system. I got started with it in 2009, and it&amp;rsquo;s what initially got me interested in embedded programming and hobby electronics. Spiritually, MegaSquirt is to car ECUs what the Raspberry Pi is for computers. It&amp;rsquo;s affordable, educational, and DIY friendly.
I am currently using a self-built MegaSquirt II to power my 1986 Mustang SVO. MegaSquirt is ideal for early fuel injection cars of the 1980s and 1990s.</description>
