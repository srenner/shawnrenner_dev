The SVO Registry was written in Python, using the Django framework, and using PostgreSQL as the data store. On the front end it has Bootstrap and a few jQuery plugins.

I am currently re-writing the site as a .NET Blazor Wasm project, and I'm making it multi-tenant so that other types of vehicles or collector items can be hosted as their own registry.
