I use a self-hosted Home Assistant installation for my home automation setup. I primarily use [Z-Wave](https://z-wavealliance.org/) devices at home because they are good quality, low power, and are not connected to the Internet. I am also curious about where [Matter](https://csa-iot.org/all-solutions/matter/) will go, because it seems to be getting attention from a lot of big tech companies.

I have placed backups of my Home Assistant configuration files in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/srenner/home-assistant-config).
