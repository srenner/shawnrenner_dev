#### Summary

This was a glorified data entry position for Sprint's "Content Stocking" system of primitive phone apps, games, ringtones, and wallpapers. My main duties at first were to analyze zip files from the content team upstream and enter file data into Excel spreadsheets. I quickly learned the filenames followed a predictable pattern, and I used VBA in Excel to automate my main duties. This led to new responsibilities within my group as Workflow Manager and Preload Manager.
