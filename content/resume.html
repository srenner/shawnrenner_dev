        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            I am a senior level software developer with proven results across multiple platforms and industries. 
            I have written software for telecommunications, manufacturing, insurance, and pharma.
        </p>
        <p>
            The majority of my experience has been in the full stack ASP.NET world, ranging from old ASP.NET WebForms systems to the newest versions of MVC, .NET Core, and Blazor.
        </p> 
            On the front end, I typically work with Bootstrap, Vue.js, Blazor, and/or Angular 1.x. 
            I have done some React Native work that is published on Google Play and the Apple App Store. 
            I'm happy to learn newer versions of Angular and/or stretch my React knowledge for the right projects.
        <p>
            I think WebAssembly is the future and would love the opportunity to work on your Wasm project! 
            I am also interested in software projects that control real world items, such as industrial automation 
            and IoT programming.

                I worked on Sprint's "Content Stocking" system of phone apps, games, ringtones, and wallpapers. 
                My main duties at first were to analyze zip files from the content team upstream, enter file data into 
                Excel spreadsheets, and send the files to the store inventory system. I quickly learned the filenames 
                followed a predictable pattern, and I used VBA in Excel to automate my main duties. This led to new 
                responsibilities within my group as Workflow Manager and Preload Manager.
